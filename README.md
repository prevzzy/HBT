# HBT
Hard Balance Trainer mod for THUG2, THAW, THUG Pro and reTHAWed. Inspired by the original THAW HBT mod. Built on core [Combo Tracker](https://github.com/prevzzy/Combo-Tracker/) code.

## Features:

 - 4 difficulty levels - (SICK difficulty should more or less match the
   original THAW HBT)
  - Toggleable by configurable hotkey
  
## Download
You can download the application from the  [releases](https://github.com/prevzzy/HBT/releases)  page.

## Installation
No installation is required. After you downloaded the .zip, unpack it and simply launch the HBT.exe.

## Troubleshooting
Make sure that the games' executable filenames match THUGPro.exe, reTHAWed.exe, THUG2.exe and THAW.exe. If you're using any modifications for these games, you may need to change the filename accordingly.

Tested to work with .exe game files found at the bottom of [this page](https://github.com/prevzzy/Combo-Tracker/releases/tag/v1.1.0).
